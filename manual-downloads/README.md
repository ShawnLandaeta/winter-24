# Manually downloaded mods

Packwiz is unable to download some mod releases and fails with an error "these mods are unable to be downloaded by packwiz (due to API limitations) and must be manually downloaded"

These releases - and only these releases - should be placed in this folder. They will be moved to the packwiz cache when exporting all jars from the modpack.
